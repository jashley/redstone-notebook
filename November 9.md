# Design notebook for week ending November 9, 2014

## Description

Not much to say here. I got caught up in reviewing for a midterm and other homework, so nothing done outside of class.
The biggest milestone is narrowing down my concept into translating Boolean Logic into Minecraft circuitry.

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

Per Prof Ben's request, I am focusing on the IR stage before moving onto the other aspects. The IR stage is coming up with
a way to translate boolean logic to function calls for Minecraft to evaluate, which shouldn't be hard. The difficulty will
be in the IR -> Minecraft stage.

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

If you have any ideas on the IR->Minecraft side, that would be fantastic, but seeing as I don't have a clear idea of how it
will work, I am not sure if you can help with that. Honestly, I need to sit down with the problem to find questions, so easy
critique for you!

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**

2 hours conidering how to implement and looking through existing Minecraft mods.

## Post-critique summary

The critique gives useful advice for how best to format the scala functions to best translate to Minecraft gates. I am not
at that stage yet, but it will certainly be a good guide.

## Post-critique reflection

The idea of having pre-composed Minecraft gates that get placed into the world was my idea as well, so it seems like I am
heading in a good direction. Onwards to the next week!
