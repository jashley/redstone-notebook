# Design notebook for week ending November 2, 2014

## Description

This past week I was not thinking too much about my project. After I firmed
up the concept of having a redstone builder, I have been focusing on other
things. This upcoming week will have more work done.

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

The biggest issues for me are setting up a java applet and figuring out exactly
how to encode the behavior of redstone. Having never built a java applet, this
is still a mystery to me, and I will be looking into it this weekend, as well
as searching for others' analysis of how redstone functions in Minecraft.

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

A little late for this, but if you know any info about making a visual gui as a java
applet, that would be awesome (I realize this isn't very well-defined at the moment).

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**

None outside of class.

## Post-critique summary
Hayden provided feedback on where to focus my endeavors. He suggested I keep focused
on the IR and worry about Minecraft integration later. He also mentioned that this
seems like a good job for a custom mod (modification) of Minecraft, and to look into
what others have already done.

## Post-critique reflection
This feedback is extremely helpful. I hadn't thought to look into other modders and what they have done
in the space of redstone, so that is something to look into. Also, this being a Minecraft mod makes
perfect sense, but never crossed my mind. I will do this, but after I have a functioning java applet
for building circuits, which is the most important aspect.
