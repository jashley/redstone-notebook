# Design notebook for week ending December 7, 2014

## Description

**TODO:** Fill in this part with information about your work this week:
important design decisions, changes to previous decisions, open questions,
exciting milestones, preliminary results, etc. Feel free to include images
(e.g., a sketch of the design or a screenshot of a running program), links to
code, and any other resources that you think will help clearly convey your
design process.

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

The past week has been incredibly busy with two onsite interviews and various other projects. Thus, I've gotten little
work done since Thursday, so I'm going to need to put in significant hours this week to get the project done. The
implementation issues are the same as last time. Given the amount of time left, I am going to work on shrinking the
circuit and likely won't have time to bridge together input wires.

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

By the time you read this, I'l be in the home stretch of the code, so if you have any last minute ideas that seem simple to
implement, let me have them! For example, I might add an ability for the user to specify the material the gates will be made
out of.

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**

I spent about an hour outside of class and about 2 hours in class, so 3 hours altogether.

## Post-critique summary

Christine talked about how she has spent a lot of time playing minecraft too and that circuitry was something she never
explored. She mentioned that I should adjust my design to make the build more user-friendly, perhaps with signs detailing
the number of blocks used, indicating which input was which variable, and placing the whole thing on a grid. She said that
the decision to have the user specify the output file was fine to her, but ultimately my decision to make. Finally, she
mentioned that my code was difficult to evaluate as it was all in one commit.

## Post-critique reflection

The sign idea is something I have considered, though I had not thought about a sign with the "statistics" of the circuit.
That could be cool and shouldn't require much more work. I have already made it so the user does not have to specify the
output file, as I felt it was unnecessary. However, when this is complete, there will be a README.txt detailing exactly what
the user needs to do to run the program (the biggest is downloading a particular python package). Finally, the code is all
in one commit because I did a huge amount of coding oiver break and committed all of it at once. This wasn't the best idea,
so sorry Christine!
